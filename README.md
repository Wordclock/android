# Wordclock Remote

![Wordclock Frontpanel][0]

This is an Android application, which can be used to control the
[Wordclock][1]. Note that the firmware needs to support the underlying UART
protocol.

For now this is **only a scaffold** demonstrating the basic design of the
application. It **doesn't provide any useful functionality** yet!

## BUILDING

Simply import the project into Eclipse. Note that you might need to import
`libs/appcompat_v7` as another project, if this particular support library
isn't part of your workspace already.
